What is cryptography?
Cryptography provides for secure communication in the presence of malicious third-partiesâ€”known as adversaries. 
Encryption uses an algorithm and a key to transform an input (i.e., plaintext) into an encrypted output (i.e., ciphertext). 
A given algorithm will always transform the same plaintext into the same ciphertext if the same key is used. 
Algorithms are considered secure if an attacker cannot determine any properties of the plaintext or key, given the ciphertext.
An attacker should not be able to determine anything about a key given a large number of plaintext/ciphertext combinations which used the key.
